# Hi 👋, I'm Matalei

### 🧠 Curious mind, data enthusiast, and former educator turning numbers into stories.

## About Me

I'm an entry-level data analyst based in the Bay Area, excited to be diving into the world of data!  
I recently completed a Business Intelligence bootcamp where I learned how to clean, explore, and visualize data using **Excel**, **Power BI**, and **Tableau**.

I enjoy working with messy data, finding meaningful patterns, and turning numbers into insights that help people make smarter decisions.

## What I'm Up To

🌱 Learning more about data tools and sharpening my data storytelling skills  
📚 Exploring real-world datasets and doing mini challenges just for fun  
🧩 Building dashboards that are not just functional—but also nice to look at  
💬 Always up for chatting about data, creative side projects, or career transitions
